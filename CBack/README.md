# Backtrack programming  
Backtrack programming is a well-known technique for solving combinatorial search problems.  
The search is organized as a multi-stage decision process where, at each stage, a choice   
among a number of alternatives is to be made. Whenever it is found that the previous choices  
cannot possibly lead to a solution, the algorithm backtracks, that is to say, re-establishes  
its state exactly as it was at the most recent choice point and chooses the next untried  
alternative at this point. If all alternatives have been tried, the algorithm backtracks   
to the previous choice point.
